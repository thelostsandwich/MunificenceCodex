The Rule of 3: Required each week to deposit 3 Blood of Sargeras worth of resources to the guild bank in order to help with materials required for raid each week(not each raid). The deposit must be witnessed by an officer for tallying. The suggested time is an hour before raid, and notifying an officer before the deposit is made. 
 
Trial: New invites or casuals attempting to become a part of the guild’s raiding team. Are not required follow the Rule of 3,  are encouraged to start contributing. 
 
Part-Time Raiders: Not subject to the 3 blood rule, yet are not guaranteed a spot in raid. 
Substitute Raiders: Not subject to the 3 blood rule, yet are not guaranteed a spot in raid. This status is the result of a benching, and will only be considered  after all Part-Time raiders available have joined the raid. 
 
Casual: Are not responsible for anything or anyone but themselves. Must show respect for other guild members, as well as a positive attitude. 
 
 
 
Attendance:
Attendance is mandatory for raiders, unless a legitimate excuse is given at least 24 hours before raid to an officer. 10+ other people are counting on you to be there, you owe them that time. This is what you signed up for.
Unexcused absences are tracked, and a warning is delivered after one unexcused day over a rolling 3 week period. 
Two unexcused missed days is a bench for the next raid week.
Three over the three week period(if allowed to join the third week) will result in demoting. 
 
 
Excused Absences are defined as the following: Unavoidable, real life events that conflict with raid time schedule and in the raiders and officers opinion take precedence to raiding.
Examples that are included but not limited to are as follows:
Yearly events 
Work
Sickness
Family
Two consecutive weeks or 3 days of excused absences over a rolling 3 week period will result in an automatic bench, with a chance of reinstatement. 
Chances at reinstatement will follow the week after being benched. You are considered Substitute Raider, and are under part-time raiders. 
 
 
 
 
Discouraged Behavior:
Our guild is meant to be a community of like minded individuals who want to build a home away from home and have fun in a video game. With that said, we highly discourage lying, cheating, stealing, causing drama, griefing, and any other negative actions or attitudes that make playing the game worse for other people. 
We ask that those that may experience any of these behaviors exhibited by any player within the guild report it to an officer, even if it is another officer or the GM. No one of any rank is above the rules set here.

Writer's Opinion:
The idea of this document is to give reference and structure to the guild, yet will not always be followed to the letter. Officers will forget their duties, raiders will be late, the GM will make mistakes. We are all human. It seems like a lot, but I write it in mind that you as a trail, raider, officer, or even GM will put forth some effort to make this idea of a community happen. The constant is that everyone should contribute, no matter how small or large. The effort is what matters, and we have days upon days to try, fail, and try again to make it work, no matter what.
